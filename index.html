<p style="font-family: Cambria ;">
    When I'm not Coding, you can often find me watching movies. Sci-fi is my all time favorite. I love listening to music as well, and I find it to be a great way to enjoy peace and spend time alone.

<h2>Experience</h2>
<div class="img" style="height: 200px;"><img src="exp.jpg" alt="profile" height="200px" width="340px"></div>
<p>Throughout my journey, I've faced a lot of struggles.And I think that a life without struggles to be boring. This path has taught me that failing to attempt is the biggest failure of life. One should fear regret more than failure. And I reinforced my belief in Karma as you get served what you deserve. Good or bad what you put out comes back to you!! I don't paint dreams or nightmares but I paint my own reality.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I'm passionate about Web Development, and I've worked on projects on building websites.</p>
